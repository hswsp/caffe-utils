## Description

The repository contains some utilities I have created to simplify procedures using [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) framework

## Content

### hdf5

The folder contains the procedure to generate hdf5 dataset from the list of images with multiple labels. The simple example of creating the dataset can be tested by running [demo.m](https://github.com/nikogamulin/caffe-utils/blob/master/hdf5/demo.m) file.
